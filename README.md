### Form Team
(_RFI Requirements a and b_)

Applying our [guidelines for forming agile teams](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/KARMA/wiki/Form_and_Evolve_Team), Stanfield Systems established a six person team to develop the KARMA prototype and prepare documentation for the RFI response.  This multidisciplinary and collaborative team includes 8 of the PQVP AD-DS Labor Categories as specified below.

- Product Manager (Christine Cox)
- Technical Architect (Patrick Grogan)
- Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester (Diana Persell)
- DevOps Engineer (Patrick Grogan)
- Delivery Manager (Tim Jacobs)
- Agile Coach (Patrick Grogan)
- Business Analyst (Christine Cox)
- Full Stack Developer #1 (Kamal Singh)
- Full Stack Developer #2 (Aben Kebede)

The Product Manager is the team leader with authority and responsibility for successful delivery of a quality working prototype.

### Explore Initial Scope
(_RFI Requirements c and d_)

_(Tie in [Explore Initial Scope](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/kmt/wiki/Explore_Initial_Scope) process description)_

Applying user-centered design techniques Stanfield Systems worked directly with users to understand what the users need to perform their tasks.  These user-centered techniques address the entire user experience from start to finish.

_(Summarize techniques and results here.  Reference process and result artifacts.)_

Based on our user-centered research and the prototype requirements from the RFI, we identified high-level user stories which were documented in our Jira project as epics forming the initial product backlog.

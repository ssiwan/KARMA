# Knowledge Article Record Management Application (KARMA) - Technical Approach

**Site URL:  https://acceptance.bigbluesign.com**

Stanfield Systems applies a [Scrum-Based, Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/KARMA/wiki) life-cycle for product development and release.  Stanfield Systems' DAD life-cycle is referenced throughout this documented with links to relevant process descriptions in the [KARMA GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/KARMA/wiki).

## Inception

Stanfield Systems begins product development with a short [Inception Phase](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/KARMA/wiki/Inception)  to achieve concurrence on the direction the team will take to deliver the product.  For the KARMA prototype, this phase lasted a single sprint (Sprint 0) and included the following activities.

### Form Team
(_RFI Requirements a, b_)

Applying our [guidelines for forming agile teams](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/KARMA/wiki/Form_and_Evolve_Team), Stanfield Systems established a six person team to develop the KARMA prototype and prepare documentation for the RFI response.  This multidisciplinary and collaborative team includes 8 of the PQVP AD-DS Labor Categories as specified below.

- Product Manager (Christine Cox)
- Technical Architect (Patrick Grogan)
- Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester (Diana Persell)
- DevOps Engineer (Patrick Grogan)
- Delivery Manager (Tim Jacobs)
- Agile Coach (Patrick Grogan)
- Business Analyst (Christine Cox)
- Full Stack Developer #1 (Kamal Singh)
- Full Stack Developer #2 (Aben Kebede)

The Product Manager is the team leader with authority and responsibility for successful delivery of a quality working prototype.

### Explore Initial Scope
(_RFI Requirements c, d_)

_(Tie in [Explore Initial Scope](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/kmt/wiki/Explore_Initial_Scope) process description)_

Applying user-centered design techniques Stanfield Systems worked directly with users to understand what the users need to perform their tasks.  These user-centered techniques address the entire user experience from start to finish.

_(Summarize techniques and results here.  Reference process and result artifacts.)_

Based on our user-centered research and the prototype requirements from the RFI, we identified high-level user stories which were documented in our Jira project as epics forming the initial product backlog.

### Technical Strategy and Work Environment
(_RFI Requirements e, f, g, h, k, l, m, o, p, r, t_)

For the KARMA prototype, Stanfield Systems' technical strategy is based on their [Work Environment Standards](https://github.com/StanfieldSystems/KARMA/wiki/Work_Environment_Standards).
